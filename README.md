## Challenges

This is my first README.

Started with a mobile first approach.
You see 3 columns and 5 rows on mobile and 5 columns, 3 rows on desktop.

Never used pagination before so this is the first.
Watched a Youtube video and followed the steps.
Then made it my own.

I know it's not a large code so components weren't necessary, but I wanted
to show I can work with them.
